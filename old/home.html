            <h3>Champ Change</h3>
            <img src="../images/CCBig.jpg" alt="cc png">
            <p> I am the senior developer for the Allen Yarnell Center for Student Success. I work on the ChampChange
                website where students book SmartyCats tutoring appointments, Coaching and Advising appointments, and
                participate in auctions & raffles with champions. There are also a lot of pages for AYCSS staff to
                manage their appointments and hundreds of reports generated to make their lives easier. <br> Developing
                on a 10+ year old LAMP stack has been a great opportunity to contribute to a large scale project
                constantly building off the work of others and ensuring that my code is easily maintainable. <br> Being
                a student developing user interfaces for students allows me to consistently get feedback from my pears
                to inform my design decisions. Additionally, creating prototypes for the other developers in the office
                to test and interact with is a great tool I frequently use when making major modifications or releasing
                a new feature.

            <img src="../images/FT-Big.jpg" alt="ft png">
            <p> Building a childproof user interface capable of recording information for research has been an
                incredibly difficult task. That said I have enjoyed creating an application for children with varying
                communication skill levels. <br> This Project also allowed me to develop my understanding of full stack
                Javascript apps as it was built with electron. Originally I was adapting the program form a legacy
                application build in java swing, but it was incapable of being adjusted to the new requirements. <br>
                Building form the ground up gave me to opportunity to talk to the research heads and 'test' proctors,
                the knowledge gained from speaking with them greatly impacted the design. I spent hours with a
                whiteboard playing around with different layouts for the different stages to create the most intuitive
                design, this allowed for rapid implication and testing. These factors enabled me to help streamline the
                proctoring workflow and make it more accessible for young children.

            <h3>UI UX Design</h3>
            <img src="../images/BigUX.jpg" alt="">
            <p> Recently for my UX class I created a prototype for a community driven boat ride-sharing app. The app is
                designed to provide additional commuting options to people living on the outer island of Casco Bay.
                Throughout the design process I learned a great deal about creating and evaluating UXs. <br> Beginning
                with interviewing commuters to creating Empathy maps + Persons then constructing low and high fidelity
                prototypes form them to finally testing my prototype on five more commuters. <br> From start to finish I
                was abele to not only hone my UI/UX skills but also include various Usability Heuristics and UX
                laws. Some of the more notable heuristics are Consistency standards for the apps icons and Flexibility
                and efficiency by creating a streamlined filter system. For the laws I paid close attention to
                are the Zeigarnik Effect by always showing users their upcoming rides and Teslerâ€™s Law by only showing
                basic ride information which can be expanded when tapped on.

        Woodworking has long been a hobby of mine. For the last few years, I
        have focused on honing my wood turning skills. Starting with locally
        sourced lumber, the process of transforming it to a polished
        finished product has become a passion. It requires unwavering
        attention and precision. I enjoy celebrating the character of the
        wood, experimenting with form and proportion to make useful,
        beautiful objects.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <img src="../images/Will.jpg" alt="me png">
    <p>
        I am a junior studying Computer Science at Montana State University.
        I grew up in Portland, Maine, where I took full advantage of easy
        access to the great outdoors spending time across the state from the waters of Casco
        Bay to the peaks of Baxter State Park.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am an avid rock climber, climbing outdoors weather allowing and train
        in the gym otherwise. I also enjoy playing Ultimate frisbee where I am
        a captain here at Montana State. While the walls and fields are covered in snow, I
        Nordic, alpine, and backcountry ski to explore the outdoors year-round.
        When I am not outdoors, I enjoy strategy games and lead a weekly game
        night. In addition, I host and maintain a dedicated server for gamming.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am a strong team player but also very comfortable striking out on my
        own to accomplish the task at hand. I bring a can-do attitude, strong
        work ethic and am able to organize and lead groups to work effectively
        together.
