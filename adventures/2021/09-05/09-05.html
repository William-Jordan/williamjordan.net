      <h2>A Smoky Alternative</h2>
      <p>
        As all good trips start, we prepared rather questionable trail mixes.
        With our tortilla bages bulging with various nuts, fruits, gummies, and
        other tasty treats at hand we were almost ready. Packing our main source
        of calories 6 boxes of mac n' cheese and a large jar of oats we were
        sufficiently stocked for our trip. <br /><br />
        We mobilize, drive around campus to pick up our companions and head
        south. The plan was simple enough: take 191 south from Bozeman to the
        start of the Madison range, follow the ridge, bag mt. Hilgard (the
        tallest), descend to avalanche lake, and hike out the following morning.
        Roughly 27 miles total and a 3 day weekend to complete it in what could
        go wrong?
        <br /><br />
        As we passed Big Sky the smoke we had noticed earlier was only
        thickening and some doubts began to spread around the car. Bush wacking
        and ridge scrambling in heavy smoke sounded both unpleasant as well as
        rather damaging to our lungs.
        <br /><br />
        We quickly tabled our plan to hike into avalanch lake that evening, bag
        Hilgard the following day and hike abck out after that. Conveniently we
        had just passed red cliff campground, home to a climbing wall on the
        list so we turned around and had a wonderful afternoon of scaling the
        picturesque red sandstone walls.

      <p>
        The five and half mile hike was easy enough, accompanied by the shaking
        of the macaroni rhythmically counting out each step. Arriving well after
        sunset we cooked two boxes and turned in for the evening. Waking up to
        dasling sunshine and the thin air at 9000’ we eat the leftover congealed
        noodles and readied ourselves for the journey to the peak. <br /><br />
        Oscar, Marty and myself had a rough idea of the direction and knew there
        was a ridgeline between our camp and the target. We figured it couldn't
        be too bad. Gaining a good viewpoint atop a rocky hilltop in the valley
        we scouted the safest route out of the valley. Along the way we saw a
        number of goats (or sheep, still don't know) until climbing a mix of
        scree and dirt tenuous held together by wind battered grass we gained
        the first ridge.
        <br /><br />
        A relatively open expanse featuring a wide variety of lichens of all
        colors, we kept plotting our course forward. Following a goat path we
        made good time traversing the treacherous terrain. Eventually we where
        presented with a wonderful view of our target peak.

      />
      <p>
        Continuing to follow the ridge we soon found it impassable, and our only
        option to descend into the valley far below and make our approach that
        way. Navigateing the steep shouts prone to loose rocks spontaneously
        causing small slides was no easy task. We each choose our own way down
        to avoid launching unwanted debris at one another. Eventually through a
        combination of careful downclimbing, well placed jumps and a fair amount
        of surfing down the sandy rocky terrain we all arrived safely on the
        valley floor. <br /><br />
        Stopping for our first snack break we greedly broke open our trail mix
        and enjoyed the clashing combination of flavors. After emptying our
        shoes of rocks, we began bounding across the larger boulders making
        fantastic time. Picking our way through massive rock deposits we found a
        small pocket of ice nestled away, perhaps all that was left of the
        glaciers that once dominated this terrain. Moving ever onwards and
        upwards we arrived at the base of Mt. Hilgard and were astonished by its
        imposing rugged rock faces and sheer height.
        <br /><br />
        Nevertheless we pushed upward, what started as a easy hike soon turned
        into a full-on scramble before eventually evolving into proper class 3
        climbing at times. Guiding each other up, pointing out loose rocks and
        solid hands, we eventually summited and were presented with an
        astounding view of the Madison range.

      <p>
        With a long descent back into the adjacent valley and another ridge to
        once again cross we wasted no time on the peak(11330’) and began
        carefully downclimbing. We Spent the best part of an hour exploring the
        lake we had spied previously from our lofty vantage point. Oscar with no
        abash stripped down and jumped into the extremely frigid snow melt-fed
        waters. Soon after Marty and then I followed suit before settling down
        for trail mix part two. The return journey to avalanche lake was
        uneventful other than surfing down the scree at rapid pace and gaining
        the odd scrape here and there.

        While the air was still quite smoky it certainly was a far better way to
        experience the outdoors than slogging through Madisons given the
        unfortunate conditions.
